## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here's how to get this project running on your machine:

### Prerequisites
You'll need Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it, grab it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for easier version management.

### Installation & Setup

```sh
# Step 1: Clone this repository to your local machine
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate into the apartment directory
cd apartment

# Step 3: Install all the necessary dependencies
npm i

# Step 4: (Optional) Set up environment variables for working forms
# See ENV_TEMPLATE.txt for instructions
# Create a .env.local file with your EmailJS credentials

# Step 5: Fire up the development server with hot reloading
npm run dev
```

That's it! The app should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite assigns). You'll see live updates as you make changes to the code.

### ðŸ“§ Setting Up Working Forms (Optional)

The contact and schedule forms are integrated with EmailJS but need configuration:

1. **Sign up at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)** (free tier: 300 emails/month)
2. **Create email templates** for contact and schedule forms
3. **Copy `ENV_TEMPLATE.txt`** and create `.env.local` with your credentials
4. **Restart dev server** to apply changes

Forms will work in "demo mode" without configuration (logs to console). See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed setup instructions.
