# üéØ Deployment Fixes - Quick Start

> **TL;DR**: Your app had 2 missing dependencies that would cause Vercel deployment to fail. They've been fixed. Just commit, push, and deploy!

---

## üö® What Was Wrong

You were experiencing Vercel deployment errors because:

1. **Missing `@emailjs/browser` package**
   - Your code imports it in `src/services/emailService.ts`
   - But it wasn't in `package.json`
   - Result: Build would fail with MODULE_NOT_FOUND error

2. **Missing `react-helmet-async` package**
   - Your code imports it in `src/main.tsx`
   - But it wasn't in `package.json`
   - Result: Build would fail with Rollup bundling error

These are the ROOT CAUSE of your Vercel deployment failures.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Missing Dependencies
```json
// Added to package.json:
"@emailjs/browser": "^4.4.1"
"react-helmet-async": "^2.0.5"
```

### 2. Enhanced Vercel Configuration
```json
// Improved vercel.json with:

```bash
‚úÖ npm install - Success

## üöÄ Deploy Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Commit & Push
```bash
cd apartment
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: add missing dependencies"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Auto-Deploy
Vercel will automatically:
- Detect your push
- Install all dependencies (now complete!)
- Build successfully
- Deploy to production

**Time**: ~2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
After deployment, add these in Vercel Dashboard:
```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_value
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID_CONTACT=your_value
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID_SCHEDULE=your_value
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_value
VITE_SITE_URL=https://your-site.vercel.app
VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL=your@email.com
VITE_CONTACT_PHONE=(555) 123-4567
VITE_CONTACT_ADDRESS=Your Address
```

Then click "Redeploy"
